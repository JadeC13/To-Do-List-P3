# # **To-Do-List-P3**
A web-based To-Do List application designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. Built with React on the frontend, the app offers a dynamic and intuitive interface for adding, editing, and organizing tasks. The Node.js backend, paired with MongoDB as the database, ensures robust data management and persistence, allowing users to seamlessly store and retrieve tasks across sessions.

## Inspriation
Our inspiration on this project was to create a way that we could all find our own separate tasks during projects or other deadlines. With this app we wanted to be able to have each person be able to have their own personal to-do list on anything that they wanted. We also wanted to make sure that each person could have their own separate folders for specific areas and have their own specific tasks within those folders
Our goal with this project was to have everone be able to easily access their own tasks within their own folders to be able to accomplish more with a lot less work.

## Issues

- **Known Issues:**
 [ - Our known issues is that our tasks and folders is not actually accessing our database. We have been trying our best to get this to be accessible but with little to no luck on the matter. We do have proof on our attempts and you can view that with the branch of "task-testing" though it is not truly working branch. To view this branch look at our github site at https://github.com/JadeC13/To-Do-List-P3 and then find the branch named "task-testing" to find it. Our Logout also "works" but only in text and not in actuality. We have also been trying to figure that out as well. We will be posting our code now and our branches include all of our tried errors and issues of what we were trying to finish.](https://github.com/JadeC13/To-Do-List-P3).
